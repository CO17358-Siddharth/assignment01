Part 1: Getting started with GitHub
All students have to make their individual github account for this course. The account name should start with your college roll no. and first name for better recognize to course faculty. for example if any one having college Roll No CS10211 and his first name as Amit then account name will be CS10211_Amit.

1. Sign up for a free Github account
2. Get the GitHub Education Pack

Part 2: Get the AS0 code

    You will download the homework starter code from GitHub.
    You will upload your homework solution code to GitHub.
    You will publish your web page(s) to the INTERNET via GitHub Pages.
1. Accept the AS0 assignment
Follow this link  https://classroom.github.com/a/EcWWPL-5 , where AS0 is stored on GitHub Classroom.
Click the green “Accept this assignment” button. 
Follow the link to your newly created assignment on the next screen. 
2. Download the AS0 starter code

Technically, your newly created assignment is a “GitHub repository.”

    This is a private repository, meaning only you (and the course staff) can access it.
    This is basically a private online folder where you will ultimately store your finished homework files. Right now, though, it contains the starter code for the assignment.

At this point, you want to download the files in this repository.
You can clone, push, and pull to this repository using the command-line or whatever UI you prefer.
If you want to use git to manage your assignment (as opposed to the GitHub web UI), just clone your assignment repository and skip to Part 3.
To download the starter code via the GitHub UI:

    In your homework repository (i.e. this screen), click the green “Clone or download” button. 
In the menu that pops up, click “Download ZIP” .
View the starter code in a browser.

Note that Chrome is the recommended browser for the course, and your TAs will be grading your assignments using the Chrome browser. Please either install and use Chrome for development, or at least make sure to test your assignments in Chrome before submitting them.

    Unzip your downloaded zip file somewhere on your computer
    Open “index.html” in Chrome or another browser of your choosing.
  Part 3: Edit the AS0 code
1. Download and install Atom
Optional: We will be using Atom in lecture, but you may use whatever text editor you’d like.
We recommend that you use the Atom text editor for CS402.
2. Fix the TODOs in index.html
    In Atom (or your preferred text editor), open index.html and fix the TODOs.
Part 4: Upload to GitHub
Now that you’ve completed the homework, you should upload your files back to your assignment 0 repository. Navigate to your assignment 0 repository on GitHub .
Click the “Upload files” button. 
On the next screen, select your index.html, style.css, and your image file for upload. Your screen should now look like the following: 
Scroll to the bottom of the screen and click the green “Commit changes” button. You don’t need to fill out any of the form. 
You should be redirected to the main repository screen again. The existing files should be updated and your new files should be uploaded.
Part 5: Publish your GitHub Page
You will now publish your website as a GitHub page. This will make your website publicly accessible on the internet. 
Navigate to your Assignment 0 repository on GitHub. (You should already be on this page.)
Click the “Settings” button. 
On the Settings page, scroll down near the bottom to the “GitHub Pages” section. Under “Source”, click the button that’s currently set to “None”… … and change it to “master branch”: Then click “Save”: 
The page will reload and you will be taken back to the top of the Settings screen.
Scroll back down to the “GitHub Pages” section, and you should now see a link to your published GitHub page. 
    Click your link to verify it is working as expected.
    Note that this is a publicly accessible link. You can send it to your friends if you want to show it off!

Note: You may notice that on the Settings page, there is an option to make the repository public. Please do not do this.

Part 6: Submit
